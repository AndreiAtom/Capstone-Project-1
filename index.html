    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a master's student at the Faculty of Geography at Babeș-Bolyai University, specializing in Regional Planning and Development. A year ago, I successfully graduated with a bachelor's degree in Territorial Planning. I am a person with a fast learning ability, always open to new challenges and changes. I consider myself to have a technical approach to problems, given that I have had the opportunity to work with applications such as ArcMap, ArcGis and ArcGis Pro, but also to create and manage databases.</p>
    <p>Currently, I want to further develop my technical skills, which is why I started taking a programming course focused on web development. In general, I am a person with a proactive attitude and a constant desire to learn and improve my professional knowledge and skills.</p>
